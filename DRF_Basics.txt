DRF -----> Django REST Framework
====     	==================
What are the Pre-requisites to learn DRF ?
	1) Python
	2) Django

Django REST Framework :
=====  =====  =========
DRF is a 3rd aprty f/w. Not developed by django people.

DRF is builting on top of Django framework only.

So it is an extension of Django only. It provides some extra Concepts or modules or classes or functions.

By using of these modules or classes it provides ready-made code insted of developers.

So that DRF is getting  more popularity in now a days.

DRF provides so many modules  to develop the RESTful API's very easily.

REST is a language independent , so we use it in Java , .Net , Python and so on.....

Q ) Why we should learn REST API ? What is the Importance of REST API ?
       =======   ======       ========         ======     =======          =========
       Rest API provides so many advntages automatically. It reduces the lot of burden on Developer or Programer. 
       Thats why people are learning now a days REST API more and more.

Advantages 0f RESTAPI :--
=========  ==========
----->>> Browsable API.
----->>> No need of Templates.
----->>> writting  less lines of code.
----->>> Built-in modules ,classes are available.
----->>> In-built Serializers support.
----->>> Extensive Documentation.
----->>> Built-In Security (Token Authentication).
------>>> Without DB opening , we can confom the data state.



Some main common words or concepts that are using in DRF .
======       ========   =====    =======     ========    ======
1 ) API 
2) Web API  /  Web Services
3) REST
4) REST API  / RESTful Web Services
5) Django REST Framework


1) API : 
=====
API ---------->>  Application Programming Interface

If we want to access the functionality of one application from another application or
from the End user then we need one Interface , That interface is called as API.

If it is Software application , then we use API for communication purpose.

If it is normal end user , then we use GUI for communication purpose.

So by using API   TWO different kind of applications will communicate to each other
 
for exchanging the Data between them.


2) Web API  /  Web Services
=========     ===========

The API which is developed to access the web applications , such type of API is called as Web API.

Web API's are also called as Web Services.
Web Service is a service which is provided over the web by some web applications.

Web API concept is applicable for web applications.
so by using the Web API , we can access services of web applications.

For Example:

REST :
=====
REST stands for Representational State Transfer .

REST is an architectural style for building the Web API's.  So REST defines several guidlines 
to develop the web api's very easily with less timely.

REST API :
=======
The API's which are developed by using the REST principles or guidlines are called as REST API's.
REST API's are using the HTTP protocols.
REST API's are also called as RESTful api's or RESTful web services.

DRF :
====
DRF is a 3rd aprty f/w. Not developed by django people.
To develop the RESTful API's we use so many tools, these tools are provided by DRF

DRF provides so many tools to develop the RESTful API's very easily.
REST is a language independent , so we use it in Java , .Net , Python and so on.....

DRF is builting on top of Django framework only.
So it is an extension of Django only. It provides some extra Concepts or modules or classes or functions.

By using of these modules or classes it provides ready-made code insted of developers.
So DRF has more popularity in now a days.


How many types of Web Services are there ?
----------------    ----------------    --------------   ----------------
Two types are there
	1) SOAP based Web Services
	2) RESTful Web Services

SOAP : 
====
SOAP -------->>> Simple Object Access protocal	

1 ) SOAP is always used XML based data
2) Biggest problem of XML is Heavy Weight
  
 syntax:   <root>
 	       <child1>Data</child1>
	       <child2>More Data</child2>
                    </root>

3) Heavy Band width needed
    For example , if any data is transfered from provider application to consumer application , then Heavy Band   width data is required.

4) Parsing the XML data is take more time. so it is not efficience.
    Note :  Parsing means reading the data from XML object types to Another object types.

5) Low performance

6) Implementing the SOAP bassed Web API's are more complexing 

so because of these common problems , the people are not using the SOAP based Web Services.

Addvantages :
=========
7) SOAP supports multiple types of protocols. for example ,  HTTP , SMTP,  FTP etc

8) WSDL uses
      If we want to send the data from one apllication to another application , we need one special language 
     called as WSDL .
     WSDL ------->Web Service Description Language .  Due to this WSDL , data has more secured  when                             transfering   between two applications over the net works. 
9) No limit on size of the data.




RESTful Web Services :
=======    ==========
REST ------> Representational State Transfer , where each URL is Representation of an object.

By using HTTP verbs/protocols , we can perform operations related to that object. 
for example , GET  ,  POST  , PUT ,  DELETE

Advantages :
=========
1) RESTful Web Services  are using JSON type based data.

2) JSON is a light weight component .

3) So when transfering of json data over networks is required less Band width.

4) No WSDL language required means we can expose directly our json data over networks by using URLs.

5) High performance 

6) Easy development 

7) Human understandable message format like plain Text (looks like Python Dictionry)

Drawbacks :
=======
1 ) Less secured to data  

2) It supports only HTTP protocal , no SMTP  ,  no FTP

3 ) Limited amount of data is transfering.






Q) Purpose of the HTTP methods ?
      ============    ===== ======

GET         --------->> To get one /more resources.
POST      --------->> To create a new resource
PUT        --------->> To update a perticular resource 
DELETE  -------->> to delete a  perticular resource.
PATCH   --------->> To partially updates the perticular resource. (means , one or two fileds.)
 


Web Service Provider :
=====  ====  =======
The application which is providing web services is called Web Service Provider.

Web Service Consumer :
=====  ====  ========
The application which is consuming web services is called Web Service Consumer

for example ,
       BookMyShow Application      <<=================>> PaymentGateWay Application
                  consumer					Provider

why because here BookMyShow app uses the services of PaymentGateWay  app for doing their activitis.
       




Relation between Database CRUD operations and HTTP methods
=========      ===========     =====   =======       ============
C      -------------->  Create                    ---------- ---------> POST
R     -------------->   Retrieve / Read   ---------  ---------> GET
U    --------------->  Update                   ---------  -------- > PUT 
D     -------------->  Delete                     ---------  --------> DELETE
